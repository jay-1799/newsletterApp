            As this new year unfolds, we are excited to see the emergence of
            transformative leadership. These individuals are restructuring
            process and procedures. This includes Sonali Rramaiah for human
            resources, John Beezley for software development, Priya Sharma, for
            program management, and Natalie Yoder for user experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            These individuals are brining significant benefit to operations and
            this will benefit those coming to practice and learn. We are also
            working to restructure our board which needs legal, intellectual
            property, and technology participants.
          </p>
          <p>And as usual, we desperately need your financial support.</p>
