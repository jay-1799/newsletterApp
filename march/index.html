          <p>
            We continue our work to complete the KeelMaster program. Software
            development suffers from turn-over: the mark of our success. We are
            hoping to counter this with shadow developers ready to step in. We
            also hope for a large donor - which would allow us to pay key people
            and reduce turnover.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our employee of the month, our featured team, and the featured
            project, highlight the amazing support from our contributors. I am
            very thankful for the many hands at work. We are proud of those
            advancing to responsible positions all over the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fundraising has fallen behind of late, with February barely topping
            $200. We need to be better at asking and thanking. We have an
            energetic marketing team - pray they can help us improve.

          <h3>ISD Design Project</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Introduction:</strong><br />
            The ISD Process App is a specialized tool designed to support
            Instructional System Designers (ISDs) by consolidating and
            streamlining the course design documentation process. Currently,
            instructional designers at KeelWorks and other organizations are
            required to use multiple, disconnected documents to manage course
            design processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            These documents include redundant information fields (e.g., course
            title, project team), and updates in one document often necessitate
            manual changes in others, leading to inefficiencies,
            inconsistencies, and potential errors. Moreover, the current method
            of documenting course design is fragmented. Designers must navigate
            between different files to access or update various components of
            the course, such as project details, design specifications, and
            revisions. This creates a time-consuming process that is prone to
            duplication of effort and confusion.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Objective:</strong><br />
            The ISD Process App will simplify this workflow by bringing all
            necessary documentation into one integrated platform. The
            application will serve as a central repository where instructional
            designers can manage all project and design information in a single
            interface, reducing the need for repetitive data entry and
            minimizing the risk of errors in document synchronization.
          </p>
          <p>
            The app will generate a course blueprint that can be further
            developed by technical developers and integrated into a Learning
            Management System (LMS). How Application Helps KeelWorks The system
            supports the foundation’s design of core competency courses central
            to the KeelMaster program improving design efficiency. Additionally,
            monetizing this tool can play a significant role in funding
            foundation operations as well as the endowment fund essential to
            supporting change for the economically disadvantaged. The Software
            as a Service (SaaS) application can be leased to other organizations
            for improved instructional design results. The application would
            also create opportunities for future interns to be involved in
            customization and product maintenance.

            <p>
                While I had prior experience in my home country, this role, post my Master's Degree, has helped me see things from a fresh perspective. I’ve learned what it takes to build and run an organization, collaborate across teams, communicate with stakeholders, handle risks, and optimize processes. This experience has shaped me both professionally and personally. I truly believe that volunteers who join KeelWorks will gain invaluable insights that will help them in their careers and beyond!
            </p>
            <p>I’m Harini Lakshminarayanan, a Program Manager - PMO at KeelWorks. I joined KeelWorks to gain corporate experience in the U.S., and my journey has been incredibly eye-opening. As part of the Project Management Office (PMO), the focus is on improving the process for onboarding Project Managers, Associate Project Managers, and Project Mentors, training, auditing, resource management, and continuous operational support, ensuring projects run smoothly. 

            </p>
            <h4>Why Harini</h4>
            <p>
              Harini is an outstanding program manager. She has picked up responsibility where there have been gaps and forced herself into leadership. Her reliability, alacrity, and common sense form her outstanding job performance. She is extremely important to the foundation assigning project managers and providing guidance to them. The foundation will be lost without her (everyone matriculates).
